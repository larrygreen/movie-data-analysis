I turned a .csv file into a Pandas DataFrame in Python. The original dataset contained a comprehensive collection of movie titles. I cleaned the data and reorganized it into smaller DataFrames to analyze highly rated movies from the 1990s, 2000s, and 2010s. I focused on the genres of action, adventure, comedy, and drama. My goal was to find the number of highly rated movies within each genre, observe the changes in these numbers over time, and form an understanding of what is behind these changes.
